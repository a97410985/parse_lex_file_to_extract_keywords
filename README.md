## file description
1. extract_keyword.java
   Would use autogenerated lexer and parser to analynize file. And use ExtractListener to extract the keyword as dictionary.
2. ExtractListener.java
   Listening the treewalk of parse tree. Listening the event like enter node and exit node. For collect keywords.
3. C.g4
   the official ANTLR grammar of C language([link](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/c)). It missing micro grammar :(, so we need use regex to remove the line start with #.


## expected behavioor

after parse the C code below
```c
#ifdef NO_YACC_SYMBOLS
#define SYM_OR_NULL(A) 0
#else
#define SYM_OR_NULL(A) A
#endif


static SYMBOL sql_functions[] = {
  { "ADDDATE",		SYM(ADDDATE_SYM)},
  { "BIT_AND",		SYM(BIT_AND)},
};

static SYMBOL symbols[] = {
  { "&&",		SYM(AND_AND_SYM)},
  { "<=",		SYM(LE)},
};
```
can get below from ExtractListener object getNames method
```java
{symbols[]=["&&", "<="], sql_functions[]=["ADDDATE", "BIT_AND"]}
```
